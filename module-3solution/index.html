						<p>Although chicken meat has been designated as the main responsible for the transmission of Campylobacter to humans, it is not responsible for 100% of the cases of campylobacteriosis. This fact suggests that there must be other sources of contamination. Almost 20% of the campylobacteriosis cases detected in the EU in 2016 were diagnosed in children under 4 years, which is strange as it is very unlikely that they eat uncooked poultry meat. In that sense, it is important to avoid drinking untreated water or milk or swallowing water while swimming, and washing hands thoroughly, always before handling food or eating, and especially after having contact with animals and pets or after children play in playgrounds or gardens. Nevertheless, further epidemiological studies should be done to get insights into the different sources and transmission routes to avoid exposure of consumers to Campylobacter.

						Disinfection of high-moisture food using cold plasma

						3 Poultry products
						Eggs and chicken meat have been in the spotlight for many years because of the high incidence of Salmonella spp. on 					these products that are commonly related to foodborne outbreaks, as shown in Fig. 5.1, besides other poultry products 					such as turkey (CDC, 2019). Egg shells have been widely studied under cold plasma processing because of the research 					need to find alternatives to conventional disinfection methodologies that are showing a lack of efficiency in sanitizing and controlling the presence of Salmonella. Other plasma studies have been focused on the inactivation of pathogens on chicken meat and chicken skin, which often offer protection to the microbial cells against common disinfection agents. Welfare issues for meat chickens have recently been comprehensively reviewed by the Animal Health and Welfare Panel of the European Food Safety Authority (de Jong et al., 2012).
